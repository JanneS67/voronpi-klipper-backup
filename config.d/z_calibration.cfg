#   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for probing on the print surface
#   (e.g. the center point) These coordinates will be adapted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh. It will raise an error if there is no
#   probe_bed site and no bed_mesh with a relative_reference_index
#   configured.

#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   This needs to be fined out manually. More on this later

#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
